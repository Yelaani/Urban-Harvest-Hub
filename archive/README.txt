ARCHIVE FOLDER
==============

This folder contains the original project files that were used as the source
for creating the task1/ and task2/ folders.

These files are kept for reference/backup purposes only and are NOT required
for assignment submission.

For submission, only the following are needed:
- task1/ folder (Task 1: Component-Based Web Application)
- task2/ folder (Task 2: Progressive Web Application)
- Root README.md (overview)

You can safely ignore or delete this archive folder if desired.
